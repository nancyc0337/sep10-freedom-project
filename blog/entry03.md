# Entry 3: Brainstorming Ideas For Music Technologies That Could Be Invented In The Future  
#### 12/18/2023

## Content: Brainstorming Part B (“Possible Future Music Technologies”)

### Part A
For Part A, we synthesize our notes so we will be ready when we put our notes on our websites. 

### Part B
For Part B, we brainstormed ideas for music technologies that could be invented in the future. 

### Freedom Project Content
For Freedom Project Content, we finalized our content by: 

* making sure that we had sufficient text on the overview, Part A and Part B

* making sure that our text was organized

* making sure we had enough image URLs.

When I was brainstorming ideas, I got some inspiration from [past projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nb-VeVd8WpX3cT0z6-XFLsbRGXGfZmOglPl-whd3ZpM/edit#gid=0):

## Engineering Design Process

Right now in the Engineering Design Process(EDP), I am on step 3(Brainstorm possible solutions). Our 3rd step is to brainstorm ideas for possible technologies that could be invented in the future. I created some ideas of possible music technologies that could be invented in the future.

Part B (“Possible Future Music Technologies”):
1) AI Music Trainer

* Purpose: To teach beginners how to create music
  * The AI Trainer will teach beginners (step-by-step instructions):
    * how to play the instruments:
      * Recorder
      * Violin
      * Guitar
      * Drums
      * Cymbal
      * Flute
      * etc
    * Learn the music concepts: 
      * Scales
      * Melody
      * Rhythm
      * Harmony
      * Tempo/dynamics
      * Timbre
    * how to read a sheet music
  * The AI Trainer can also ask any questions about music and answer them back 
* Free of charge (No fees)
* For all ages
* In all languages

2) Music Watch

* The watch would listen to your heart and blood pressure, then it’ll identify how you’re feeling
* After the watch identifies your feeling, the watch can provide the type of music to help with the situation
* Example:
  * If you are stressed out about something(like tests, exams, work, etc), the watch can provide you with classical, nature, or instrumental music to calm you down
  * If you are happy, the watch can provide you with happy music
  * If you are sad, the watch can provide you with sad music

## Skills

1) Organization

The 1st skill I learned during this process is **Organization**. 

During the process of part A, part B and the Freedom Project Content, we organized our notes by using bullet points. Whenever I made a new bullet point, I click `shift` and `8` on my keyboard. Then I click `space` on my keyboard. If I want to make a sub-bullet point, I first make a bullet point, then I click the `tab` on my keyboard.

Outcome (Example):

* My Schedule
  * Algebra II
    * Mr. Rubin
  * BHP (Big History Honors Project)
    * Ms. Musacchio 
  * Lunch  
  * AP World History
    * Mr. Shapiro  
  * Spanish
    * Mr. Galland 
  * SEP
    * Mr. Mueller
  * ELA
    * Mr. Lewis
    * Ms. Plumb  
  * Chemistry
    * Mr. Wong
    * Mr. Eldebek  
  * Yoga
    * Mr. Morton 

2) Creativity

The 2nd skill I learned during this process is **Creativity**. 

For Part B, we have to create ideas of our topic technologies that could be invented in the future. I used my creativity to think of 2 music technologies that could be invented in the future.
