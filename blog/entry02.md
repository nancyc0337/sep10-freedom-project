## Content: The Information I Gathered About Software & Hardware And How I Gathered It

I found 

## Sources

The first link I searched was [8 Collaborative Music Apps To Make Music With Anyone, Anywhere](https://www.mi.edu/in-the-know/8-collaborative-music-apps-make-music-anyone-anywhere/). This link helps me to know what 8 Music Apps are collaborative.

The second link I searched was [The 5 Pieces Of Kit Every Hardware Musician Needs, According to An Expert](https://mixmag.net/feature/hardware-musician-kit-producer-studio-music-reverb). This link helps me to know what kind of hardware every musician needs.

## Engineering Design Process

Right now in the Engineering Design Process(EDP), I am on the 2nd step(Research the problem). Our 2nd step is to research our problem. Our problem is most people are not informed about some of the technology(software/hardware) that exists in my topic (Music). My website is going to solve the problem. So I have to research what kinds of software & hardware music technologies people haven't heard of. 

## Skills

1) How to Google

The 1st skill I learned during this process is **How to Google**. 

When I was researching my topic, I searched **music apps**. But the results led me to a lot of music apps most people have heard of. So I decided to change my words to **music apps/software past** in the search engine. It led me to this website: [8 Collaborative Music Apps To Make Music With Anyone, Anywhere](https://www.mi.edu/in-the-know/8-collaborative-music-apps-make-music-anyone-anywhere/). When I skimmed over it, I saw that this website has the information I need for my project. 

2) Growth mindset

The 2nd skill I learned during this process is **Growth mindset**. 

When I was researching my topic, I saw that most of the music apps I researched most people have heard of like YouTube Music, Pandora, Spotify, and more. I feel like I'm getting a little frustrated. So I decided to be a little patient and use the skill **How to Google** and change my words in the search engine. 

## Summary
In conclusion, I'm looking forward to the 3rd step of the Engineering Design Process: which is **Brainstorming possible solutions**.
