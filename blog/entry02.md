#### 11/27/2023

## Content: 



## Sources



## Engineering Design Process

Right now in the Engineering Design Process(EDP), I am on the 2nd step(Research the problem).

## Skills

1) How to Google

The 1st skill I learned during this process is **How to Google**. 

When I searched "_technology in music_" in the search engine, there were 3,150,000,000 results. Of course, that is a lot of results and there might be links that I might not use. So I skimmed through the titles and descriptions on the links. When I saw "**The Impact of Technology on the Music Industry**" and "**How Technology Has Changed Music Over the Years**", I saw that these links would help what I need to find for my project.    

2) Problem Decomposition

The 2nd skill I learned during this process is **Problem Decomposition**. 

When I was choosing my topic, I was a little uncertain of what topic to choose. So I decided to choose the topic I liked the most and which topic I could do more research on. During my research, I have more links for Music. So I chose Music for my topic. 
Also when I was writing this blog entry, I broke my task into 5 parts: Content, Sources, Engineering Design Process, Skills, and Summary. Then using the rubric, to work on each part. 

## Summary
In conclusion, I'm delighted to make my website about using technology in Music to help my target audience. Maybe I will have a future career that involves Music.
