## Content: Choosing Tool And Tinkering With Tool

The tool I chose is called Aframe. Aframe is a web framework that makes a 3D virtual reality. I used [this website](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) to help me learn Aframe. I tinkered with Aframe using [jsbin.com](jsbin.com). I changed colors, add new 3D shapes and changed positions of the 3D shapes.
