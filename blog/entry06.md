## Sources

During this time, I used my IDE (cs50.dev) to put in my code for the freedom project website.

When I had trouble with my css, I used [CSS-W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) to fix my bug in the code to get the response that I want.

When I wanted to add a bootstrap components, I used [Bootstrap-Components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/accordion/) to add bootstrap components that I need for my website.

## Engineering Design Process

Right now in the Engineering Design Process(EDP), I am on the 5th (Create a prototype), 6th (Test and evaluate the prototype) and 7th (Improve as needed) step. During this time, we created our Freedom Project website and we tested the prototype. Currently, we are improving our website to make it even better. We are going to edit any bugs, change any colors, etc.

## Skills

1) Attention to detail

The first skill I learned during this process is **Attention to detail**.

The skill Attention to detail is about spelling things correctly, adhering to syntax rules, etc.

2) Debugging

The second skill I learned during this process is **Debugging**.

The skill Debugging is about reading errors, tinkering, talking through the problem (RDD).

3) Problem decomposition

The third skill I learned during this process is **Problem Decomposition**

The skill Problem Decomposition is about breaking a task down into smaller pieces. During this time, I break my problem(making the freedom project website) down into smaller pieces. I did each page of the website with each of the timeframe. I did the easy parts of the coding like copying the contents and replace them with HTML. I leave the hard parts like css & responsive till I'm finished with my HTML.

## Summary
In conclusion, I'm ready to keep editing my Freedom Project website and getting ready to present my product to others.
