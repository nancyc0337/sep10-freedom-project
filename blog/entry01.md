# Entry 1: Settling On My Topic (Music) For The Year-Long Freedom-Project 
#### 10/23/2023

## Content: Why Did I Choose Music For My Freedom-Project? 

The topic I decided on for this Freedom Project is **Music**. 
I chose this topic because I played the recorder and violin when I was in elementary school. Using my phone, I always liked to listen to music when I was not in school. I also use my computer to listen to music too. Music makes me feel high-spirited and cheerful. I know there are many types of music: Classical, Rock, Pop, Jazz, Hip-Hop, Blues, Country, and more. Everyone likes different types of music. It shows their true selves and their culture.  

My backup ideas were Sports and Arts And Crafts. 

## Sources

The first link I searched was [How Technology Has Changed Music Over the Years](https://victrola.com/blogs/articles/how-technology-has-changed-music-over-the-years). This link helps me to know what kinds of technology are used in music and how technology changed music over time.   

The second link I searched was [The Impact of Technology on the Music Industry](https://online.suu.edu/degrees/business/master-music-technology/tech-impact-music-industry/). This link helps me to know the impact of technology on the Music Industry. 

Another link I found was: [6 ways music technology has changed for good](https://www.wiley.com/edge/media/how-technology-has-changed-music/). This link helps me to know technology in music has changed for the better.

## Engineering Design Process

Right now in the Engineering Design Process(EDP), I am on the 1st(Define the problem) and 2nd step(Research the problem). Our 1st step was to choose 3 topics we were most interested in. Then we searched on Google for [tech term: tech, technology] in [topic], [topic] jobs, and day in the life of a [topic job]. I think I'll be on 2nd step to search for a problem and brainstorm solutions.    

## Skills

1) How to Google

The 1st skill I learned during this process is **How to Google**. 

When I searched "_technology in music_" in the search engine, there were 3,150,000,000 results. Of course, that is a lot of results and there might be links that I might not use. So I skimmed through the titles and descriptions on the links. When I saw "**The Impact of Technology on the Music Industry**" and "**How Technology Has Changed Music Over the Years**", I saw that these links would help what I need to find for my project.    

2) Problem Decomposition

The 2nd skill I learned during this process is **Problem Decomposition**. 

When I was choosing my topic, I was a little uncertain of what topic to choose. So I decided to choose the topic I liked the most and which topic I could do more research on. During my research, I have more links for Music. So I chose Music for my topic. 
Also when I was writing this blog entry, I broke my task into 5 parts: Content, Sources, Engineering Design Process, Skills, and Summary. Then using the rubric, to work on each part. 

## Summary
In conclusion, I'm delighted to make my website about using technology in Music to help my target audience. Maybe I will have a future career that involves Music.
