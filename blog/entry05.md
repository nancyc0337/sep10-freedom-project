# Entry 5: Confirming Tool To Use For My Freedom Project
#### 4/8/2024

## Content: Learning About Aframe

The tool I chose is called Aframe. I chose Aframe because Aframe is a web framework that makes a 3D virtual reality. It'll create a great virtual reality for my freedom project about music. During this time, I used many resources to learn Aframe.

I learned many Aframe components like:

* basic lighting
* sound
* gltf-model
* camera
* scale
* background
* geometry, 3D-shapes
* rotation
* position
* animations
* `<a-text>`

## Engineering Design Process

Right now in the Engineering Design Process(EDP), I am on the 4th step(Plan the most promising solution). Our 4th step is to plan our solution. Currently, we are learning our tool we chose on our own(#loyo). For the next step, we are planning for our Wireframe and the MVP for our Freedom Project website.

## Skills

The first skill I learned during this process is **how to learn**.

The skill how to learn is called #loyo, which means "Learn On Your Own." During this process, we have to learn a tool on our own for our freedom project. I used many resources to learn aframe tinker with Aframe.

Resources:
